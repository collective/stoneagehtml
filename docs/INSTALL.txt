StoneageHTML Installation
----------------------------------

To install StoneageHTML into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:

* When you're reading this you have probably already run
  ``easy_install stoneagehtml``. Find out how to install setuptools
  (and EasyInstall) here:
  http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall


Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout recipe to manage your project, you
can do this:

* Add ``stoneagehtml`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        stoneagehtml


* Re-run buildout, e.g. with:

    $ ./bin/buildout

You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.
